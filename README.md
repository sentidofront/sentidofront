### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a front-end developer with a strong background in web3 and expertise in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of React, I am passionate about creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. My love for art and my natural ability to learn new things on my own have allowed me to become a self-taught developer. I have taught myself development principles and techniques through online courses and tutorials and have gained a strong understanding of web technologies.

In addition to my experience as a front-end developer, I have also developed skills as a UX/UI designer, specializing in Figma and the Adobe Creative Suite. I have applied my skills to various successful projects, including designing the UX/UI for the Universidade LibertÃ¡ria DAO and the Universidade LibertÃ¡ria website. My designs have consistently received positive feedback from users and have contributed to increased engagement and satisfaction.

I am constantly seeking to learn and improve my skills, staying up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies by attending industry events and workshops. As a curious and empathetic person, I am interested in working as a UX designer because I want to help companies create products that are easy and enjoyable to use. My ability to prototype and wireframe, as well as my experience with visual communication, allows me to effectively show how the product will look and work. My strong communication and collaboration skills also allow me to work well with others to create a great product.

I am excited about the opportunity to join a team of talented designers and developers and contribute to the success of their products. I am confident that my skills and experience make me an excellent fit for a Front End Dev/UX/UI Designer position and I look forward to the opportunity to work with your team.
