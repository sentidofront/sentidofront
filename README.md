### The horror of the world is that it is always collapsing, but the beauty of the world is that it is always being created. ⚙

I am a Front-End Developer and UX/UI Designer with a passion for creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. My journey began with a love for cinema and media expressions, which led me to acquire skills with Adobe After Effects, Premiere, DaVinci, Vegas, Photoshop, and Affinity 6. Through my work as a translator for the Cybernetic Research Unit of the Warwick University, I had the opportunity to research in Schizoanalysis and Deleuzean practices, which have deeply influenced my perspective as a designer and developer.

As a self-taught developer, I have taught myself development principles and techniques through online courses and tutorials, and gained a strong understanding of web technologies, including Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, I have developed skills as a UX/UI designer, specializing in Figma and the Adobe Creative Suite. My designs have consistently received positive feedback from users and have contributed to increased engagement and satisfaction.

My curiosity and empathy are driving forces in my passion for UX design. I enjoy helping companies create products that are easy and enjoyable to use. My ability to prototype and wireframe, as well as my experience with visual communication, allows me to effectively show how the product will look and work. I also have strong communication and collaboration skills, which enable me to work well with others to create a great product.

I am constantly seeking to learn and improve my skills, staying up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies by attending industry events and workshops.
